To get started with creating your own DSP effects, download the kX API / SDK here. Some familiarity with C/C++ programming, MFC, Visual C and DSP programming techniques is assumed.

If you are interested in creating your own effects - or have already created some - please review the 'Effects and the DSP' section of our Support Forum. 

Also, make sure to review A Beginner's Practical Guide to Programming Digital Audio Effects on the E-MU10kx family of DSPs, if you are interested in developing your own DSP effects.
Don't forget to review our links page -- some of them are DSP-related. ï»¿

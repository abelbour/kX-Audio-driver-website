A change has been made to the kX alpha and beta-testing protocol:
kX pre-release versions will now be made available publicly for download and testing. It is expected that by expanding the base of kX beta testers, a wider range of potential bugs will be identified, so that they may be eliminated before the "official" release of new versions.
Please note that alpha and beta release versions may not be entirely stable 
and are not recommended for general use. We encourage experienced and 
dedicated kX users to download and install pre-release versions to provide 
us with invaluable pre-release feedback.

A change has been made to the kX alpha and beta-testing protocol, due mainly to time constraints and to the hardware/software configuration limitations of our current beta-testing team.

Of course, as always, donations to the kX fund from any and all kX users are much appreciated!;-)

09/12/2002 - Version 5.10.0.3523 ALPHA released.

A big thank you goes out to those of you who have made donations to the kX project - thanks to you, the kX team has finally obtained an Audigy Platinum, which will be immediately subjected to further study - the ensuing development should be of benefit to all.
At the same time, as long as work continues there will be costs to be paid (such as webhosting, etc.) and of course your continuing donations will always provide additional incentive and motivation to the kX team, to keep on doing what they've been doing all along - namely providing free high-performance WDM drivers for the 10kx cards. Thanks for your encouragement.

Yes, ASIO Recording finally implemented.

ASIO recording may not be entirely stable with 10k1-based cards. Also, under certain circumstances, you may experience problems with input channels being shifted.
In order to use ASIO recording, some familiarity with kX DSP is required (you should know how to connect any desired recording source to epilog->asio0,1,2, etc.).
ASIO recording may not work properly with 5.1 cards (model sb0060), as they have not been fully tested. ASIO1 and ASIO2 recording sources are shared with analog center/analog subwoofer outputs (due to hardware limitations).

New article discussing Via 686B Southbridge chipset problems added.
